# Packages overview

## Frontend & Backend

- eslint - Analyses the code for stylistic and coding errors, based on the .eslintrc.
  Can optionally be used with the cli e.g. `yarn run eslint example/target.js`.
- prettier - Code formatter, can be combined with eslint, by using eslint-plugin-prettier and eslint-config-prettier. https://prettier.io/docs/en/eslint.html
- eslint-plugin-prettier - Runs Prettier as an ESLint rule and reports differences as individual ESLint issues.
- eslint-config-prettier - Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

## Frontend

- webpack - Will bundle the react app, allows us to split the code
- webpack-cli - Allows us to use webpack with the cli. Needed to run webpack as a yarn script
- webpack-dev-server - Only needed for development, will watch for changes and automatically create a new bundle
- webpack-merge - Allows us to split the webpack config in multiple files
- html-webpack-plugin - The plugin will generate an HTML5 file for you that includes all your webpack bundles in the body using script tags.

- ts-transform-graphql-tag - needed to import gql type definitions.
- ts-jest - TypeScript preprocessor with source map support for Jest that lets you use Jest to test projects written in TypeScript.
- @types/\* - types for specified libs, needed for TypeScript usage
- awesome-typescript-loader - helps Webpack compile your TypeScript code using the TypeScriptâ€™s standard configuration file.
